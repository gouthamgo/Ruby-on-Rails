- Rails comes equipped with scripts called generators that will automatically create everything you need to start working on a new project.
## To use the new generator we will run the following command:
```
- rails new my_project
```
```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'hello/index'
  # add line here
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
end
```
